# Zero-Knowledge KYC

## User Story

As a user concerned about privacy, I need to complete identity verification without revealing personal information to the escrow platform, so that I can comply with regulations while maintaining my privacy and security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. zkMe Protocol Integration
- System integrates with zkMe SDK for zero-knowledge identity verification
- KYC process operates on ZetaChain testnet for cross-chain compatibility
- Users generate zero-knowledge proofs of identity without revealing PII
- Integration supports multiple identity verification levels (basic, enhanced, premium)
- zkMe credentials are linked to user's Solana wallet address

### 2. Testnet Implementation
- KYC verification operates on ZetaChain Athens testnet
- Testnet integration allows for hackathon demonstration without mainnet costs
- Mock identity providers simulate real-world verification scenarios
- Test credentials are clearly marked and separate from production data
- Testnet limitations and future mainnet migration path are documented

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Verification
- Zero-knowledge proofs verify identity attributes without data exposure
- Verification status is stored as cryptographic commitments on-chain
- Personal data never leaves user's device during verification process
- Proof generation happens locally using zkMe's client-side SDK
- Verification results are tamper-proof and cryptographically verifiable

### 4. Cross-Chain Credential Management
- zkMe credentials are accessible across multiple blockchain networks
- ZetaChain enables omnichain identity verification for future multi-chain expansion
- Credential revocation and updates are handled through zkMe's infrastructure
- Cross-chain messaging ensures verification status synchronization
- Universal identity enables seamless user experience across chains

### 5. Compliance and Audit Trail
- KYC verification meets regulatory requirements without compromising privacy
- Audit trail records verification events without storing personal data
- Compliance reports can be generated for regulatory authorities
- Zero-knowledge proofs provide mathematical certainty of verification
- System supports various jurisdiction-specific compliance requirements
