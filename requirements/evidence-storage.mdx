# Evidence Storage

## User Story

As a user submitting evidence for task verification, I need a decentralized storage system that ensures my files are permanently accessible and tamper-proof, so that my evidence remains available for AI verification and potential dispute resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. IPFS Integration
- All evidence files are stored on IPFS for decentralized accessibility
- Content addressing ensures file integrity through cryptographic hashes
- Files are automatically pinned to prevent garbage collection
- IPFS gateways provide redundant access paths for file retrieval
- Content deduplication reduces storage costs for identical files

### 2. Web3.Storage Service Integration
- Web3.Storage provides reliable IPFS pinning and CDN acceleration
- API integration handles file uploads with progress tracking
- Automatic backup ensures evidence availability across multiple nodes
- Service-level agreements guarantee long-term file persistence
- Integration includes error handling and retry mechanisms for failed uploads

### 3. File Type Support and Validation
- Support for multiple evidence formats (images, documents, videos, text)
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- Size limits prevent abuse while accommodating legitimate evidence
- Metadata extraction captures file properties for AI analysis
- Virus scanning protects users from malicious content

### 4. Access Control and Privacy
- Evidence files are encrypted before IPFS storage
- Access keys are managed through smart contract permissions
- Time-limited access tokens enable secure evidence sharing
- Privacy controls allow users to restrict evidence visibility
- Audit trails track all evidence access and sharing events

### 5. Integration with Verification Pipeline
- Evidence IPFS hashes are recorded on-chain for immutability
- AI verification system retrieves files directly from IPFS
- Batch processing optimizes evidence retrieval for multiple files
- Caching mechanisms improve performance for frequently accessed evidence
- Evidence linking connects related files for comprehensive analysis
