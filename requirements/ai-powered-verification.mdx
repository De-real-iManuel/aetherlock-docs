# AI-Powered Verification

## User Story

As a payee who has completed work, I need an AI system to automatically verify my task completion by analyzing submitted evidence, so that I can receive payment quickly without waiting for manual review or potential human bias.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. AWS Bedrock Integration
- System integrates with AWS Bedrock Claude for natural language processing
- AI model analyzes task descriptions and completion evidence
- Bedrock API calls are authenticated using AWS IAM roles
- Response parsing handles various Claude output formats
- Integration includes fallback mechanisms for API failures

### 2. Evidence Analysis Pipeline
- AI processes multiple evidence types (text, images, documents, URLs)
- Evidence is retrieved from IPFS and prepared for AI analysis
- Claude generates structured verification reports with confidence scores
- Analysis includes task requirement matching and completion assessment
- Processing pipeline handles large files through chunking strategies

### 3. Verification Decision Logic
- AI verification results are categorized as Approved, Rejected, or Needs Review
- Confidence thresholds determine automatic approval (>90% confidence)
- Low confidence results (50-90%) trigger human review workflow
- Very low confidence (<50%) results in automatic rejection with feedback
- Decision logic is transparent and auditable through event logs

### 4. Feedback and Iteration
- Rejected verifications include detailed AI-generated feedback
- Users can resubmit evidence with improvements based on AI suggestions
- System learns from dispute resolution outcomes to improve accuracy
- Feedback loop includes human reviewer corrections for model training
- Iterative refinement process documented for hackathon demonstration

### 5. Performance and Reliability
- Verification processing completes within 30 seconds for standard submissions
- System handles concurrent verification requests efficiently
- Bedrock API rate limiting is managed with exponential backoff
- Verification results are cached to prevent duplicate processing
- Error handling provides clear user feedback for failed verifications
