# Escrow Creation and Fund Management

## User Story

As a user wanting to create a trustless transaction, I need to be able to create an escrow account, deposit funds, and have those funds managed securely until task completion is verified by AI, so that I can engage in commerce without requiring trust in counterparties.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Escrow Account Creation
- Users can create escrow accounts with customizable parameters (amount, deadline, task description)
- Each escrow generates a unique Program Derived Address (PDA) on Solana
- Escrow metadata is stored on IPFS with hash recorded on-chain
- Creation requires both parties to sign the initial agreement
- Gas fees are calculated and displayed before transaction confirmation

### 2. Fund Deposit and Lock
- Payer can deposit SOL or SPL tokens into the escrow account
- Funds are immediately locked and cannot be withdrawn until conditions are met
- Deposit transaction is atomic and reverts if any step fails
- Real-time balance updates are reflected in the cyberpunk dashboard
- Deposit confirmation triggers notification to all parties

### 3. Multi-Signature Authorization
- Critical operations require signatures from relevant parties
- Payee must approve escrow terms before funds can be deposited
- Emergency functions require additional authorization layers
- Signature verification uses Solana's native cryptographic functions
- All signature events are logged for audit purposes

### 4. Treasury Fee Management
- 2% protocol fee is automatically calculated and reserved
- Treasury fees are collected only upon successful escrow completion
- Fee structure is transparent and displayed during escrow creation
- Protocol treasury account receives fees via Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
- Fee collection events are emitted for tracking and analytics

### 5. Fund Release Mechanisms
- Funds are released automatically upon AI verification of task completion
- Manual release requires consensus from dispute resolution system
- Partial releases are supported for milestone-based projects
- Release transactions include detailed event logs for transparency
- Failed releases trigger automatic dispute resolution workflow
