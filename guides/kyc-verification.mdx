# KYC Verification Guide

<Warning>
**Current Implementation Status**: AetherLock is actively integrating with zkMe, our official partner for zero-knowledge KYC. A **mock KYC flow** is currently available for development and testing purposes. **Real Integration Coming Soon** - Full zkMe SDK integration with zero-knowledge proofs will be available in the production release.
</Warning>

AetherLock Protocol uses zkMe for zero-knowledge identity verification, ensuring your privacy while meeting compliance requirements. This guide describes both the current mock implementation and the planned full integration.

## What is zkMe?

<Note>
**Integration Partner**: zkMe is AetherLock's official Integration Partner for zero-knowledge KYC. The integration is currently in progress. The mock flow simulates the verification process for development purposes.
</Note>

zkMe provides zero-knowledge KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, allowing you to prove your identity without revealing personal information on-chain.

### Current Status: Mock KYC Flow

**Real Integration Coming Soon**: The full zkMe SDK integration with zero-knowledge proofs is currently in active development with our integration partner zkMe. The production release will include complete privacy-preserving verification.

**Current Status**: Mock KYC flow for development and testing purposes.
</Warning>

AetherLock's planned KYC implementation will use advanced cryptography:

```typescript
// Example: Zero-knowledge proof verification (Planned Implementation)
interface ZKProof {
  proof: string;           // Cryptographic proof
  publicSignals: string[]; // Public verification data
  verificationKey: string; // Verification key
}

const verifyIdentity = (proof: ZKProof): boolean => {
  // Verify proof without revealing identity
  return zkSnark.verify(proof.verificationKey, proof.publicSignals, proof.proof);
};
```

### Data Protection (Planned)

**Planned Security Features**:
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted with AES-256
- **Storage**: Minimal data stored, maximum privacy
- **Access**: Strict access controls and audit logs
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 compliant

AetherLock's planned KYC implementation will meet requirements for:
- **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**: Transaction monitoring
- **CFT (Counter-Financing of Terrorism)**: Risk assessment
- **FATF Guidelines**: International standards compliance
- **Local Regulations**: Jurisdiction-specific requirements

## Next Steps

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is my personal information stored on the blockchain?">
**Planned Implementation**: Once the full zkMe SDK integration is complete, only an anonymous cryptographic proof of your verification will be stored on-chain. Your personal information will never leave your device and will not be stored by AetherLock or zkMe. The current mock flow simulates this process for development purposes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does KYC verification take?">
**Current Mock Flow**: Instant verification for development and testing purposes. **Planned Production**: Most verifications will complete automatically within 2 minutes once the full zkMe SDK integration is live. Complex cases may require manual review, taking up to 24 hours.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use the same KYC for multiple wallets?">
Yes, you can link multiple wallet addresses to the same KYC verification. This allows you to use different wallets while maintaining your verified status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my KYC expires?">
You have a 30-day grace period to renew. During this time, you can complete existing escrows but cannot create new ones. Renewal typically takes just a few minutes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I delete my KYC data?">
Yes, you can request data deletion at any time. This will remove your verification status and require re-verification for future use. On-chain proofs cannot be deleted but contain no personal information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is KYC required for all AetherLock features?">
KYC is required for creating escrows and participating as a service provider. You can browse the platform and view public escrows without verification.
</Accordion>
