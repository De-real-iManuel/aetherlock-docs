### Unit Economics Deep Dive

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by Channel
| Channel | CAC | Payback Period | LTV/CAC Ratio |
|---------|-----|----------------|---------------|
| **Organic/Referral** | $25 | 0.5 transactions | 20x |
| **Content Marketing** | $75 | 1.5 transactions | 6.7x |
| **Paid Social** | $150 | 3 transactions | 3.3x |
| **Enterprise Sales** | $2,500 | 5 transactions | 20x |

#### Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation
```
Average Customer Metrics:
- Monthly transactions: 2
- Average transaction value: $3,000
- Revenue per transaction: $300 (10%)
- Customer lifespan: 24 months
- Monthly churn rate: 4%

LTV = (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin × Lifespan) / Churn Rate
LTV = ($600 × 95% × 24) / 0.04 = $342,000

Conservative LTV (accounting for competition): $5,000
Target CAC: $500 (10:1 LTV/CAC ratio)
```

### Profit Margin Evolution & Break-Even Analysis

#### Break-Even Calculation
```
Fixed Costs (Year 1): $755K
Variable Cost per Transaction: $0.08 (Arcanum.ai + blockchain + storage)
Revenue per Transaction (avg): $300

Break-Even = Fixed Costs / (Revenue - Variable Costs)
Break-Even = $755K / ($300 - $0.08) = 2,518 transactions

Monthly Break-Even: 210 transactions
Daily Break-Even: 7 transactions
```

#### Margin Improvement Over Time
```
Year 1 (10K transactions):
- Revenue: $2.5M
- Variable costs: $0.8K (10K × $0.08)
- Fixed costs: $755K
- Profit: $1.74M (69.7% margin)

Year 3 (200K transactions):
- Revenue: $100M
- Variable costs: $16K (200K × $0.08)
- Fixed costs: $10M
- Profit: $89.98M (89.98% margin)

Year 5 (500K transactions):
- Revenue: $300M
- Variable costs: $20K (500K × $0.04 with volume discount)
- Fixed costs: $45M
- Profit: $254.98M (85.0% margin)

Note: Variable costs updated to reflect Arcanum.ai pricing ($0.05 base + $0.03 other costs = $0.08 total, reducing to $0.04 AI cost with volume discounts at scale)
