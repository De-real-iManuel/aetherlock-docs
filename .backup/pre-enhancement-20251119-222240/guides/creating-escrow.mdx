## Troubleshooting

### Common Creation Issues

#### Insufficient Funds

**Problem**: Not enough tokens to cover escrow + fees

**Solution**:
1. Check your wallet balance
2. Account for platform fees (10% of escrow amount)
3. Ensure sufficient gas fees for transaction
4. Consider using a stablecoin for predictable costs

```typescript
// Calculate total required funds
const calculateTotalCost = (escrowAmount: number) => {
  const platformFee = escrowAmount * 0.10;  // 10% AetherLock fee
  const gasFee = 0.01;                      // Estimated gas
  return escrowAmount + platformFee + gasFee;
};
```

#### KYC Issues

**Problem**: KYC verification not recognized

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the page and reconnect wallet
2. Check KYC status in account settings
3. Complete verification if still pending
4. Contact support if verification is approved but not recognized

#### Network Congestion

**Problem**: Transaction fails due to network issues

**Solutions**:
1. Increase gas fee for faster processing
2. Wait for network congestion to decrease
3. Try during off-peak hours
4. Switch to a less congested network if available

### Form Validation Errors

#### Required Fields

Ensure all required fields are completed:
- Project title and description
- Budget amount and currency
- Timeline and deadlines
- Acceptance criteria
- Service provider information (for direct escrows)

#### Character Limits

Stay within specified limits:
- **Title**: 100 characters maximum
- **Description**: 2,000 characters maximum
- **Requirements**: 5,000 characters maximum
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 1,000 characters per criterion

#### Invalid Addresses

For direct escrows, ensure:
- Wallet address is valid for the selected network
- Address is properly formatted (base58 for Solana, hex for others)
- Provider has completed KYC verification
- Address is not blacklisted or flagged

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I cancel an escrow after creation?">
Yes, but only under specific conditions:

- Mutual agreement with the provider (may incur fees)
- In case of fraud or terms violation (requires dispute resolution)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I make a mistake in the escrow details?">
Minor details can often be updated with provider agreement. Major changes (amount, deliverables) may require creating a new escrow. Contact support immediately if you notice critical errors.
</Accordion>
