**Note**: This implementation plan was generated and refined using AI-assisted development tools, showcasing the power of AI in creating comprehensive blockchain solutions. The iterative feedback loop enabled rapid prototyping and feature refinement throughout the hackathon development process.

**Demo Ready**: AetherLock Protocol is fully functional on Solana devnet with Arcanum.ai AI verification and PoTV (Proof-of-Task Verification) consensus mechanism, ready for demonstration. The system uses Arcanum.ai as the primary AI provider with automatic fallback to OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini for maximum reliability.
