# AetherLock Protocol - Product Overview

AetherLock is a decentralized omnichain escrow protocol that solves the fundamental problem of trustlessly verifying digital task completion. It introduces **Proof-of-Task Verification (PoTV)**, an AI-powered consensus mechanism.

**Current Status**: Deployed on Solana Devnet

## Core Value Proposition

Traditional escrow systems fail when validating if digital deliverables meet requirements, if evidence is authentic, and if both parties are acting honestly. AetherLock solves this with:

- **Digital Proof-of-Task Verification (D-PoTV)**: Currently implemented for digital tasks only (code, design, writing, data analysis) using AI verification, requirement-output matching, and fraud detection
- **Physical Proof-of-Task Verification (P-PoTV)**: FUTURE ROADMAP - For physical goods and offline services using logistics verification, multi-source evidence, AI authenticity checks, and zero-knowledge location proofs

## Key Features

- **Omnichain Escrow**: Solana Devnet (primary), ZetaChain Testnet for cross-chain messaging
- **AI-Powered Verification**: Arcanum.ai integration with 2.1s average verification time (D-PoTV only)
- **Zero-Knowledge KYC**: zkMe SDK integration in progress (mock flow currently)
- **Trustless Execution**: Smart contract-enforced fund custody with no intermediary control
- **10% Protocol Fee**: Automatically collected during fund release

## Target Markets

- E-commerce physical deliveries: $5.7T market
- Freelance services: $1.5T market
- Cross-border trade: $25T market
- P2P marketplaces: $2.3T market

## Performance Metrics

- D-PoTV verification: 2.1 seconds average (D-PoTV only, 241,920x faster than manual review)
- Speed comparison: 2.1s vs 5-7 days traditional manual review
- Accuracy: Validation pending (production testing required)
- Supported task types: Digital tasks only (code, design, writing, data analysis)
- P-PoTV metrics: Future roadmap (not yet implemented)
