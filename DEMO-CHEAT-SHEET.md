## 🎬 Script Flow

### 1. Opening (15s) - TAB 1
**Show:** 4-step cards
> "Hi everyone. I'm Emmanuel. AetherLock solves trustless task verification. Let me walk you through the technical architecture."

### 2. Problem (20s) - STAY TAB 1
**Point to:** Step 3 (AI Verifies)
> "Traditional escrow fails at verification. Human mediators take 5-7 days. We built AI verification in 2.1 seconds."

### 3. PoTV Innovation (30s) - TAB 3
**Show:** D-PoTV architecture diagram
> "Proof-of-Task Verification - consensus for work validation. AI analyzes requirements, authenticity, fraud. 2.1 seconds. 241,920x faster."

### 4. Architecture (45s) - TAB 2
**Show:** System architecture diagram
> "Solana Devnet + Anchor. Live contract at 2kkNXo...5b6N - verifiable on Solana Explorer. Sub-second finality. PDAs for custody. State machine enforcement.
> ZetaChain for omnichain. Cross-chain escrows.
> Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Socket.io for real-time updates."

### 5. AI Deep Dive (30s) - TAB 3
**Show:** D-PoTV Flow Diagram (parallel boxes)
> "Arcanum.ai three-stage pipeline:
> 1. NLP requirement extraction
> 2. Hash verification with integrity checks
> 3. Fraud detection - plagiarism, AI content
> Ed25519 signatures. IPFS + SHA-256. Immutable audit trail."

### 6. Security (20s) - STAY TAB 3
**Point to:** Security components
> "zkMe zero-knowledge KYC. Reentrancy protection. Role-based access control. Multi-sig admin. AI keys in secure enclaves."

### 7. Flow Demo (20s) - TAB 1
**Show:** Sequence diagram (scroll down)
> "Alice hires Bob. Creates escrow, funds SOL. Bob submits to IPFS. AI verifies in 2 seconds. Smart contract releases 90% to Bob, 10% fee. Done."

### 8. Development Tools (25s) - TAB 4
**Show:** amazon-q-usage.mdx screenshots
> "We leveraged Kiro IDE and Amazon Q Developer. Kiro's spec-driven development scaffolded this 45+ page documentation. Amazon Q helped solve critical problems - PDA derivation, cross-chain encoding. When we hit Bedrock rate limits, Q guided us to Arcanum.ai, improving speed by 40%. Kiro audited all documentation for consistency."

### 9. Closing (10s) - ANY TAB
> "$34 trillion market. Freelancing, e-commerce, cross-border trade. Trustless verification. Thank you."

## ✅ Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] All 3 tabs open and bookmarked
- [ ] Screen share tested
- [ ] Practiced 3x with timer
- [ ] Water nearby
- [ ] Backup: can describe diagrams verbally if screen share fails

## 🎯 Timing Checkpoints

- **0:35** - Should be starting Architecture section
- **1:20** - Should be starting AI Deep Dive
- **2:10** - Should be starting Flow Demo
- **2:30** - Should be starting Development Tools
- **3:05** - Should be wrapping up

If behind schedule, **skip Security section** (20s) to catch up and stay under 3:15.
