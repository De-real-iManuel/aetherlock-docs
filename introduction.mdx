# AetherLock Protocol

AetherLock is a next-generation AI-driven escrow protocol built on Solana, designed to revolutionize trustless transactions through intelligent automation and zero-knowledge privacy. By combining AWS Bedrock's advanced AI capabilities with zkMe's privacy-preserving KYC and Solana's high-performance blockchain, AetherLock creates a seamless, secure, and intelligent escrow experience.

## Overview

AetherLock Protocol introduces a new paradigm in decentralized escrow services by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate task verification, dispute resolution, and compliance checks. The protocol ensures complete transparency while maintaining user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and provides a cyberpunk-inspired user interface that makes complex blockchain interactions intuitive.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Verification**: AWS Bedrock Claude integration for intelligent task validation
- **Zero-Knowledge KYC**: Automatic zkMe SDK verification with cross-chain credentials
- **Omnichain Architecture**: Solana, TON, Sui via ZetaChain with multi-wallet support
- **IPFS Evidence Storage**: Decentralized storage for dispute resolution materials
- **Automated Dispute Resolution**: AI-assisted conflict resolution with human oversight
- **Cyberpunk Dashboard**: Immersive React interface with Framer Motion animations

## How It Works

1. **Multi-Chain Wallet Connection**: Users connect via Solflare, Slush, or Tonkeeper wallets
2. **zkMe Identity Verification**: Automatic KYC verification screen using zkMe SDK
3. **Escrow Service Access**: UI enables escrow functionality after successful verification
4. **Fund Authorization**: AetherLock requests wallet authorization for transaction amount + 2% fee
5. **AI Verification**: Analyzes both on-chain and off-chain data for transaction validation
6. **Automated Fund Release**: Smart contract releases funds to buyer with automatic fee collection

AetherLock represents the future of trustless commerce, where AI and blockchain converge to create truly autonomous financial infrastructure.
