# AetherLock Protocol

AetherLock is a next-generation AI-driven escrow protocol built on Solana, designed to revolutionize trustless transactions through intelligent automation and zero-knowledge privacy. By combining AWS Bedrock's advanced AI capabilities with zkMe's privacy-preserving KYC and Solana's high-performance blockchain, AetherLock creates a seamless, secure, and intelligent escrow experience.

## Overview

AetherLock Protocol introduces a new paradigm in decentralized escrow services by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate task verification, dispute resolution, and compliance checks. The protocol ensures complete transparency while maintaining user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and provides a cyberpunk-inspired user interface that makes complex blockchain interactions intuitive.
