# AetherLock Protocol

AetherLock is a next-generation AI-driven escrow protocol built on Solana, designed to revolutionize trustless transactions through intelligent automation and zero-knowledge privacy. By combining AWS Bedrock's advanced AI capabilities with zkMe's privacy-preserving KYC and Solana's high-performance blockchain, AetherLock creates a seamless, secure, and intelligent escrow experience.

## Overview

AetherLock Protocol introduces a new paradigm in decentralized escrow services by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate task verification, dispute resolution, and compliance checks. The protocol ensures complete transparency while maintaining user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and provides a cyberpunk-inspired user interface that makes complex blockchain interactions intuitive.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Verification**: AWS Bedrock Claude integration for intelligent task validation
- **Zero-Knowledge KYC**: Privacy-preserving identity verification via zkMe on ZetaChain
- **Multi-Chain Architecture**: Solana MVP with planned expansion to other chains
- **IPFS Evidence Storage**: Decentralized storage for dispute resolution materials
- **Automated Dispute Resolution**: AI-assisted conflict resolution with human oversight
- **Cyberpunk Dashboard**: Immersive React interface with Framer Motion animations
