# Design Overview

## Multi-Chain Vision

AetherLock Protocol is architected as a multi-chain escrow platform with Solana as the initial MVP implementation. The design prioritizes interoperability, scalability, and AI-driven automation while maintaining security and user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Modular Design
- **Blockchain Layer**: Pluggable smart contract implementations per chain
- **AI Layer**: Chain-agnostic verification engine using AWS Bedrock
- **Privacy Layer**: Universal zkMe integration via ZetaChain omnichain
- **Storage Layer**: Decentralized IPFS storage accessible across all chains
- **Interface Layer**: Unified frontend supporting multiple wallet types

### Interoperability Framework
- **ZetaChain Integration**: Enables cross-chain messaging and universal identity
- **Omnichain Contracts**: Smart contracts deployable across multiple blockchains
- **Universal Wallet Support**: MetaMask, Phantom, and other chain-specific wallets
- **Cross-Chain Evidence**: IPFS ensures evidence accessibility regardless of origin chain
- **Unified User Experience**: Single interface for multi-chain escrow management

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- **Primary Chain**: Solana (MVP implementation)
- **Future Chains**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base
- **Cross-Chain**: ZetaChain for omnichain functionality
- **Smart Contracts**: Rust (Anchor) for Solana, Solidity for EVM chains

### AI and Verification
- **AI Engine**: AWS Bedrock with Claude models
- **Processing**: Natural language understanding and evidence analysis
- **Decision Logic**: Confidence-based automated verification
- **Learning**: Feedback loops for continuous improvement

### Privacy and Identity
- **KYC Protocol**: zkMe zero-knowledge identity verification
- **Privacy Preservation**: Zero-knowledge proofs for compliance
- **Cross-Chain Identity**: Universal credentials via ZetaChain
- **Data Protection**: Client-side proof generation

### Storage and Infrastructure
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS via Web3.Storage
- **Evidence Management**: Encrypted file storage with access controls
- **Metadata**: On-chain hashes for integrity verification
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for performance optimization

## Scalability Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent AI verification for multiple escrows
- **Caching Strategies**: Evidence and verification result caching
- **Load Balancing**: Distributed AI processing across AWS regions
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient indexing for rapid escrow discovery

### Cost Management
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimal on-chain operations to reduce fees
- **Batch Processing**: Grouped operations for efficiency
- **Layer 2 Integration**: Future support for L2 solutions
- **Treasury Sustainability**: 2% fee structure for protocol maintenance

This multi-chain architecture positions AetherLock as a universal escrow solution, capable of serving users across the entire blockchain ecosystem while maintaining consistent security, privacy, and user experience standards.
