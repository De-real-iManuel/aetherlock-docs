- **AWS Bedrock**: Claude model integration for intelligent analysis
- **Real-Time Processing**: Sub-30 second verification times
- **Confidence Scoring**: Automated decision making based on AI confidence
- **Continuous Learning**: Feedback loops for improved accuracy

### Zero-Knowledge Identity
- **zkMe SDK Integration**: Automatic KYC verification popup
- **Privacy Preservation**: Zero-knowledge proofs for compliance
- **Cross-Chain Credentials**: Universal identity via ZetaChain
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Enterprise-grade KYC without data exposure
- **Seamless UX**: One-time verification for all chains

### Smart Contract Architecture
- **Fund Locking**: Secure escrow with 2% station fee
- **Automated Release**: AI-triggered fund distribution
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: ZetaChain omnichain communication
- **Fee Collection**: Automatic treasury management
- **Emergency Controls**: Multi-signature safety mechanisms

## User Journey Flow

### 1. Wallet Connection
```
User → Select Chain → Connect Wallet (Solflare/Slush/Tonkeeper) → Wallet Connected
```

### 2. Identity Verification
```
Wallet Connected → zkMe Popup → KYC Verification → ZK Proof → ZetaChain → Verified
```

### 3. Escrow Creation
```
Verified User → Create Escrow → Set Amount → Wallet Authorization → Funds Locked
```

### 4. AI Verification
```
Evidence Submitted → On-Chain Data + Off-Chain Data → AI Analysis → Verification Result
```

### 5. Transaction Completion
```
AI Approved → Smart Contract → Release Funds → Collect 2% Fee → Transaction Complete
```

## Technical Architecture

### Omnichain Infrastructure
- **ZetaChain Hub**: Central coordination for cross-chain operations
