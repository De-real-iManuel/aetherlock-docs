# ZetaChain Deployment Guide (Testnet Only)

> **⚠️ TESTNET ONLY**: ZetaChain integration is currently deployed on testnet only. Mainnet deployment is not yet available.

> **Note**: This section is under development. Complete Hardhat deployment instructions will be added in subsequent tasks.

## Overview

Deploy AetherLock's Universal App contract to ZetaChain testnet for cross-chain messaging functionality. This deployment enables omnichain escrow operations across supported blockchain networks in a testnet environment.

## Current Status

**Deployment Status**: Testnet Only

AetherLock's ZetaChain integration is currently available on testnet networks for development and testing purposes. The following limitations apply:

### Testnet Limitations

- **No Mainnet Deployment**: Production deployment to ZetaChain mainnet is not yet available
- **Testnet Tokens Only**: All transactions use testnet tokens with no real value
- **Limited Cross-Chain Support**: Cross-chain messaging is available only between testnet networks
- **No Production Guarantees**: Testnet deployments may be reset or experience downtime
- **Callback Handlers Not Implemented**: `onRevert` and `onAbort` handlers are planned but not yet implemented
- **Testing Environment**: Suitable for development and testing only, not for production use

### What Works on Testnet

- Basic Universal App contract deployment
- Cross-chain message sending (testnet to testnet)
- Gateway integration for omnichain messaging
- Contract verification on testnet explorers

### What's Not Available

- Mainnet deployment
- Production-grade cross-chain callbacks
- Real-value transactions
- Full error handling and revert mechanisms

## Coming Soon

The following features are planned for future releases:

- Complete Hardhat configuration
- Automated deployment scripts
- Network-specific deployment instructions
- Contract verification procedures
- Gateway configuration details
- Mainnet deployment guide (when available)
- Full callback handler implementation

## Planned Production Deployment

Production deployment to ZetaChain mainnet is planned for Phase 3 of the AetherLock roadmap. This will include:

- Mainnet Universal App deployment
- Complete callback handler implementation (`onRevert`, `onAbort`)
- Production-grade cross-chain message flow
- Full error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Integration with mainnet networks (Solana, TON, Sui)

**Estimated Timeline**: 3 weeks with Kiro IDE (see roadmap for details)
