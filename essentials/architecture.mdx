# üß† AetherLock Technical Architecture

AetherLock is an AI-driven, agentic escrow and P2P protocol that enables secure, automated transactions with AI-powered verification.  
It integrates **ZetaChain**, **zkMe (zkKYC)**, **Solana**, and **AWS** to build a trustless, omnichain escrow service for the Web3 ecosystem.

---

## üß© System Overview

The AetherLock ecosystem connects multiple core modules:

| Layer | Component | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Blockchain Layer | **Solana / ZetaChain** | Core escrow contract layer + omnichain bridge |
| Identity Layer | **zkMe (zkKYC)** | Privacy-preserving KYC validation |
| AI Layer | **AI Agents + Verification Oracle** | Off-chain verification and signature relay |
| Application Layer | **Kiro IDE Frontend** | Developer environment for integration, testing, and interface design |
| Infrastructure | **AWS** | Cloud compute and AI model hosting |
| Treasury | **Protocol Treasury** | Escrow fees and protocol revenue management |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

### üß± Escrow Contract (Solana)
- Holds funds and manages release/refund logic.
- Integrates ZetaChain for cross-chain fund control.
- Emits events to AI verification service.

### üß† AI Agent & Verification Oracle
- Performs off-chain validation of task completion.
- Signs verification payloads (Ed25519).
- Relays signed proofs back on-chain through oracle.

### üõ°Ô∏è zkMe Integration (ZetaChain)
- Provides zero-knowledge KYC verification.
- Stores credential proofs on **ZetaChain testnet**.
- Allows participation only for verified users without revealing identity data.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Cloud Services
- Hosts backend AI services and evidence storage API.
- Enables real-time analytics and monitoring dashboard.

### üé® Frontend (Kiro IDE + React)
- Built using **Kiro IDE** and **React**.
- Provides intuitive UI for escrow management, verification tracking, and dispute resolution.
- Integrates Phantom, Solflare, and WalletConnect for wallet interactions.

## üåê ZetaChain Integration Context

**ZetaChain Bounty #1 ‚Äî Solana/Sui/TON Universal App (Assigned to Kiro)**

**Objective:**  
Implement and design the frontend + integration structure for the ZetaChain Universal App within AetherLock‚Äôs ecosystem.

**Integration Goals:**
- Connect Solana and/or Sui/TON ecosystems through ZetaChain.
- Use ZetaChain contracts & interfaces ‚Üí `Gateway`, `Universal NFT`.
- Implement omnichain functions:
  ```ts
  onCall()
  onRevert()
  onAbort()
