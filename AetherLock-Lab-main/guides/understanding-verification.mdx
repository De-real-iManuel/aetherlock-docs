# Understanding Verification Results

Learn how to interpret AI verification results, understand confidence scores, and navigate the decision-making process on AetherLock Protocol. This guide covers all possible outcomes and your options for each scenario.

## Verification Process Overview

### How AI Verification Works

AetherLock's Proof of Task Verification (PoTv) uses advanced AI models to analyze your submitted evidence against the original project requirements. The process involves multiple layers of analysis:

<Steps>
<Step title="Evidence Analysis">
1. **Content Extraction**: AI analyzes images, videos, documents, and code
2. **Requirement Mapping**: Matches evidence to specific project criteria
3. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates completeness and accuracy
4. **Cross-Validation**: Checks consistency across multiple evidence pieces
</Step>

<Step title="Confidence Scoring">
1. **Individual Scores**: Each requirement gets a confidence score (0-100%)
2. **Weighted Average**: Scores combined based on requirement importance
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential issues or ambiguities
4. **Final Decision**: Determines approval, rejection, or human review need
</Step>

<Step title="Result Generation">
1. **Decision Output**: Clear approve/reject/review recommendation
2. **Detailed Feedback**: Specific comments on each requirement
3. **Evidence Mapping**: Shows which evidence supports each decision
4. **Next Steps**: Provides actionable guidance for any issues
</Step>
</Steps>

### Verification Timeline

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How accurate is the AI verification system?">
AetherLock's AI verification system maintains a 94.2% accuracy rate across all decisions. High-confidence decisions (85%+ score) have a 97.8% accuracy rate, while medium-confidence decisions requiring human review have an 89.1% accuracy rate. The system is continuously improved based on feedback and outcomes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I request human review even for approved decisions?">
While approved decisions are final, you can request a review within 7 days if you believe there was a technical error or if you have concerns about the decision. However, this is rare since approved decisions indicate high confidence that requirements were met.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I disagree with the human reviewer's decision?">
If you disagree with a human reviewer's decision, you can file a dispute within 7 days. The dispute will be handled by a senior reviewer who will conduct a fresh, independent analysis of all evidence. This is the final level of review before the appeal process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do I have to resubmit after rejection?">
You have 7 days from the rejection notification to resubmit improved evidence. This deadline is firm and cannot be extended except in exceptional circumstances (such as platform technical issues). You can resubmit up to 3 times per escrow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can the client influence the verification decision?">
Clients cannot directly influence AI verification decisions, which are based solely on evidence and requirements. However, clients can provide input during human reviews and dispute processes. The original requirements document serves as the authoritative source for verification criteria.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my evidence contains proprietary or sensitive information?">
All evidence is handled with strict confidentiality and security measures. Evidence is encrypted during transmission and storage, and access is limited to authorized verification personnel. Evidence is automatically deleted after 1 year unless there are ongoing disputes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I see the detailed AI analysis of my evidence?">
Yes, you receive a detailed breakdown showing how each piece of evidence was analyzed, which requirements it addresses, and the confidence score for each requirement. This helps you understand the decision and improve future submissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if there are technical issues during verification?">
If technical issues prevent proper verification (such as IPFS access problems or corrupted files), the verification will be paused and you'll be notified. You'll have the opportunity to resubmit affected evidence without penalty. The verification timeline is extended accordingly.
</Accordion>
