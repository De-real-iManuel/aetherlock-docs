# Zero-Knowledge KYC Requirements

## Overview

This document defines the functional requirements for AetherLock's privacy-preserving Know Your Customer (KYC) verification system powered by zkMe. The system enables regulatory compliance while maintaining user privacy through zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs.

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

4. **WHEN** verification is processing **THEN** the system SHALL show real-time status updates and estimated completion time
5. **WHEN** verification is complete **THEN** the system SHALL display a success confirmation with details about what was verified and credential validity period

### User Story 5: Regulatory Compliance Officer

**As a** compliance officer  
**I want** to verify that users meet regulatory requirements  
**So that** AetherLock operates within legal frameworks while respecting user privacy

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **WHEN** I generate compliance reports **THEN** the system SHALL provide aggregate statistics on verification levels without exposing individual user data
2. **WHEN** regulators request audit information **THEN** the system SHALL demonstrate cryptographic proof of verification without revealing personal information
3. **WHEN** new regulations are implemented **THEN** the system SHALL support configurable verification requirements per jurisdiction
4. **WHEN** suspicious activity is detected **THEN** the system SHALL flag accounts while maintaining privacy protections for legitimate users
5. **WHEN** compliance violations occur **THEN** the system SHALL provide mechanisms for credential revocation and account restrictions

### User Story 6: Developer Integration

**As a** developer integrating with AetherLock  
**I want** clear APIs for checking KYC status  
**So that** I can build compliant applications without handling sensitive user data

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **WHEN** I query a user's KYC status **THEN** the API SHALL return verification level and validity without exposing personal information
2. **WHEN** I implement KYC checks **THEN** the system SHALL provide boolean verification results for different compliance requirements
3. **WHEN** I need to verify specific attributes **THEN** the system SHALL support selective disclosure proofs for required fields only
4. **WHEN** verification status changes **THEN** the system SHALL provide webhook notifications for real-time updates
5. **WHEN** I integrate the verification widget **THEN** the system SHALL provide comprehensive SDK documentation with code examples

### User Story 7: Security Auditor

**As a** security auditor  
**I want** to verify the cryptographic integrity of the KYC system  
**So that** I can ensure the privacy and security claims are mathematically sound

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **WHEN** I examine zero-knowledge proofs **THEN** the system SHALL use industry-standard cryptographic primitives (Groth16, BN254 curves)
2. **WHEN** I verify proof generation **THEN** the system SHALL demonstrate that proofs cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal personal data
3. **WHEN** I test replay attacks **THEN** the system SHALL prevent reuse of proofs through cryptographic nonces and timestamps
4. **WHEN** I analyze on-chain data **THEN** the system SHALL store only non-reversible cryptographic commitments
5. **WHEN** I review the verification process **THEN** the system SHALL provide complete audit trails without compromising user privacy

## Privacy Preservation Requirements

### Data Minimization
- **Personal Data Isolation**: Personal information never leaves the user's device during verification
- **Cryptographic Commitments**: Only mathematical proofs and hashes are stored on-chain
- **Selective Disclosure**: Users can prove specific attributes without revealing others
- **Automatic Expiration**: Credentials automatically expire to limit data exposure over time

### Zero-Knowledge Properties
- **Completeness**: Valid proofs always verify correctly
- **Soundness**: Invalid proofs cannot be accepted as valid
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Verification reveals no information beyond the proven statement
- **Non-Interactive**: Proofs can be verified without interaction with the prover

### Cross-Chain Privacy
- **Consistent Privacy**: Same privacy guarantees across all supported blockchain networks
- **Encrypted Messaging**: Cross-chain communications use end-to-end encryption
- **Decentralized Verification**: No single point of failure for privacy protection
